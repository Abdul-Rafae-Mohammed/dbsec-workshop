# Database Security Workshop: Advanced Security - Transparent Data Encryption

![](images/WorkshopHeader/100.png)

## Introduction

This is the first of several labs which are part of **Oracle Database Security Workshop.** This workshop will walk you through the process configuring, validating and using all of Oracle's Database Securtity products

Oracle Advanced Security comprises two security features to protect sensitive database data. The first feature is Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) which encrypts data "at rest." Encryption is done using a key that must be available to a database that either reads or writes encrypted data. The encryption is performed inside the data files that store the Oracle Database data. It remains encrypted until it is retrieved from disk for use in an application. This is true for any other use of the data files—exporting tables, backing up data files, and so on—the data included in the export file or on backup disks or tapes will remain encrypted until used in a database with a matching encryption key.

## Overview

In this lab exercise, you will accomplish the following:
- Validate the status of the encryption keys using Oracle Enterprise Manager  Cloud Control
- OFFLINE the EMPLOYEESEARCH_DATA tablespace
- Migrate the tablespace to an encrypted tablespace 
- Verify that encryption has taken place


## Required Artifacts

- The following lab requires:
  - Laptop (Windows, Mac or Linux)
    - If running  Windows: [Putty and PuttyGen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  - VNC client
  - Oracle 18c Database
  - Enterprise Manager 13c


## Encrypting your data

### **STEP 1**: Getting the environment ready

- On the Oracle Linux Desktop, navigate to the DB_Security_Labs folder, double-click and open the contents. 

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Select the folder, Oracle_Advanced_Security_OAS.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Select the folder, OAS_-_Getting_The_Environment_Ready.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- In the OAS_-_Getting_The_Environment_Ready folder, select Start_OAS_Infrastructure.sh.  This script will start the entire necessary infrastructure used in these lab exercises. In these lab exercises, use the Display button to view the contents of the scripts before executing.  This will allow you to review the steps, commands and scripts used in these exercises.  When executing scripts, use the Run in Terminal button.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Please be patient as the infrastructure may take a little time to start.  Once the infrastructure has started, you are ready to move forward with the exercises.

### **STEP 2**: Encrypting a Tablespace

- After the Start_OAS_Infrastructure.sh script finishes (see the steps at the end of the section B), open the Labs folder on the Oracle Linux Desktop, and navigate to the Oracle Advanced Security OAS folder.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Log in with the credentials SYSMAN/Oracle123 and navigate to the PDB Database home page by selecting the Databases menu item from the 'Targets' drop down menu as shown below.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Expand the tree structures and click the pluggable database 'cdb_PDB1' as shown.  There may be additional targets, but cdb_PDB1 will appear in the Pluggable Databases tree.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

  This opens the PDB1 home page.  Review the status of your environment by selecting Security → Transparent Data Encryption. 

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

  If the Database Login page appears, then log in as an administrative user, such as SYS. User SYS must log in with the SYSDBA role selected.  For convenience, select from one of the saved Named Credentials for PDB1.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Expand on the Keystore and Master Keys section in the lower left hand corner and review the information provided in the Oracle Advanced Security – Transparent Data Encryption screen.  Notice that the Keystore Status is OPEN and you have one Master Key in use—pdb1.   You can now encrypt data within the database.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Under Encrypted Objects, click Refresh on Encrypted Tablespaces. Within a few seconds you should see EMPLOYEESEARCH_DATA back ONLINE with AES128 encryption

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Back in the Oracle_Advanced_Security, click 03_Search_Strings_Encrypted.sh and verify that the data has been encrypted.  It will look similar to this screenshot

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Finally, return to the Security -> Transparent Data Encryption Section.

  Review in the Encrypted Objects section that the tablespace, HR_ENC is encrypted with the Encryption Algorithm your chose during the exercise.




### **STEP 3**: Fork Repository github.com/packer-workshop/packer-oci from GitHub

Using git is very common for cloud development, it provides source control and management of software, configuration and documentation files.  For the purposes of this workshop, you make use of GitHub for its ability to store, view and edit important files used in image creation - details allowing packer to build in your OCI environment

By forking our workshop's github repository to YOUR github account, you have a working copy of this lab, allowing you to edit files (add your cloud identifiers to a json file) using the web interface of github. You can also keep any assets you create, even when your trial expires.

- From a **new window** any browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/packer-workshop/packer-oci" target="new">github.com/packer-workshop/packer-oci</a>

- Click **Fork** in the upper right hand corner of the browser. **Sign in** if prompted.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

  **NOTE:** If prompted, choose to fork the repository to your account (this may occur if your account is also a member of an organization on GitHub).

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)
  you might catch:

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

-  You will see that a copy of the _packer-oci_ repository is now in your Github account.  This will allow you to make changes to items tied to your Cloud Account.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

### **STEP 4**: Create a Copy of variables.json

-  Using your browser, **navigate** in your Github repository to:  

    -  **workshops -> packer-oci ->packer_scripts**

- There, you should see:

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

-  **Open** variables.json using the browser interface.

- Click the filename **variables.json**, bringing up the files, Highlight the template variables, and copy them to your clipboard (cntrl-C or &#8984;-C)

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- **Return to packer_scripts directory** - click on *packer_scripts*:

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- **Create a new file** - using the create new file button.

-  **Paste** the contents of *variables.json* from your clipboard

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

- Call it **DevDesktop.json** (since it will be a docker developer's desktop image). This file will store the variables (OCID, region and base image) specific to your Cloud tenancy.

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)



- **Commit** the file, with a comment, using the button below the Editor

  ![](images/Lab100/0.1x.png)

As you navigate around Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you will want to keep your _DevDesktop.json_ file open to collect the required identifiers.  As you create compartments and networks, you will be asked to paste identifiers into this file.  

### **STEP 5**: Create a Compartment

Compartments are used to isolate resources within your OCI tenant. User & Group-based access policies can be applied to manage access to compute instances and other resources within a Compartment.

- In the top left corner of the dashboard, click the **hamburger menu**

  ![](images/Lab100/3.1.png)
  ![](images/Lab100/3.2.png)

- Select to expand the **Identity** submenu, then click **Compartments**

  ![](images/Lab100/4.1.png)

- Click **Create Compartment**

  ![](images/Lab100/5.1.png)

- In the **Name** field, enter any name you want. For this example you will use the name `Packer`. Enter a **Description** of your choice. Click **Create Compartment**.

  ![](images/Lab100/8.1.png)

- In a moment, your new Compartment will show up in the list.

  ![](images/Lab100/9.1.png)

### **STEP 6**: Collect Packer Compartment's OCID

- Now, you can copy the new compartments OCID to the DevDesktop.json file from step 3 by using the *copy* link

  ![](images/Lab100/4.3.png)

- **Copy** This value and **Paste** into your _DevDesktop.json_ file's, compartment:

  ![](images/Lab100/3.11.png)

### **STEP 7**: Create a Virtual Cloud Network

You need a VCN to define the network you'll use in the `Packer` compartment (_Or the name you used for your compartment_). This Virtual Cloud Network is where things like Subnets and Security Lists get defined for each Availability Domain in your Tenancy. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is hosted in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area (e.g. PHX or IAD), and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region (e.g. IAD - AD1). A region is composed of several availability domains. Availability domains are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously. Because availability domains do not share infrastructure such as power or cooling, or the internal availability domain network, a failure at one availability domain is unlikely to impact the availability of the others.

All the availability domains in a region are connected to each other by a low latency, high bandwidth network, which makes it possible for you to provide high-availability connectivity to the Internet and customer premises, and to build replicated systems in multiple availability domains for both high-availability and disaster recovery.

- Click the **hamburger icon** in the upper left corner to open the navigation menu. Under the **Networking** section of the menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks**

    ![](images/Lab100/10.png)

  - Select your **compartment** from the LOV.

    ![](images/Lab100/10.1.png)

  - Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

    ![](images/Lab100/11.1.png)

  - Enter **packer-build** for the Name and select the **Create Virtual Cloud Network Plus Related Resources** option as highlighted below:

    ![](images/Lab100/12.1.png)

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

    ![](images/Lab100/13.png)

- Click **Close** on the details page after noticing the VNC and Subnets created.:

    ![](images/Lab100/14.png)

This means that you have a network, "packer-build" defined to have 3 subnets, each one in an isolated availability domain.

- **Click** on the Packer-build VCN to get OCID of the subnets.

    ![](images/Lab100/5.2.png)

### **STEP 8**: Collect Packer-build subnet OCID

- Now you can **copy** one of the subnet's OCID to the _DevDesktop.json_ file from step 3 by using the *copy* link.  

  ![](images/Lab100/5.3.png)

- For consistency, use AD-1 (at the bottom) as your subnet.  You won't run into problems as long as you pick the matching subnet & AD (e.g AD2 with Subnet2, AD1 with Subnet1, etc.)

  ![](images/Lab100/5.2.5.png)

- Back in your browser window, update your _DevDesktop.json_ file. Highlight `pasteYourSubnetsOCID`, **pasting** the OCID value after:

  ![](images/Lab100/5.5.png)    

Now you have your compartment and subnet defined in your variables file.

### **STEP 9**: Add a Security List entry

A security list provides a virtual firewall for an instance. The Security List contains ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out. Each security list is enforced at the instance level, however, you configure your security lists at the subnet level. This applies the same set of rules to each instances in a given subnet. The security lists apply to a given instance whether it's interacting with another instance in the VCN or a host outside the VCN.

- Select **Security Lists** from the left hand menu.

    ![](images/Lab100/Lab100-8c5849b9.png)

- Next select "Default Security List for packer-build" under **Security Lists**

  ![](images/Lab100/17.1.png)

For the purposes of the upcoming Packer-built image deployments, you need to add a couple of Ingress Rules that allow VNC access from the Internet to ports 5910 and 5911.

- Click **Edit All Rules** and then select **+ Another Ingress Rule**

  **`NOTE: Our goal is to add new rule, not change existing ones...`**

  ![](images/Lab100/18.1.png)

  ![](images/Lab100/19.1.png)

- **Enter the following as Rule 4 (or the next in your tenant)**

**NOTE:** Leave all other values at default

```
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
Destination Port Range: 5910-5911
```

- Click the **Save Security List Rules** button at the bottom of the page

  ![](images/Lab100/22.1.png)

- Your Ingress Rules should look like:

  ![](images/Lab100/22.2.png)

 This opens port 5910 & 5911 to the public internet! for the purposes of this lab, you should be fine.  If you do this in any other account (e.g. not your 30-day trial), pay close attention to the ports your open.  You can enter very narrow port ranges to lock port access down to a single corporate network, or corporate networks + hosted servers specifically designed to access and audit administrative access to cloud instances.  

### **STEP 10 Mac/Linux**: Create SSH Key Pair (Linux or Mac client)

Before you create the Compute instance that will host the packer install, you need to create an ssh key pair, allowing you to securely connect to the instance.

**NOTE:** `This step focuses on key pair generation for Linux or Mac based terminal sessions. If your going to run your terminal sessions from a Windows client then skip to STEP 11`

- In a `Linux/Mac` client terminal window **Type** the following (**You don't have to worry about any passphrases unless you want to enter one**)

  - **type**  mkdir Keys

  - **type** cd Keys (taking your into your directory)
\
  - **type** ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f packerkey

```
mkdir Keys
cd Keys
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f packerkey
```

- Your key pair is now in the current directory.  You will have two files (the pair) which make up the symmetric key.  The private key should remain only in secure locations to protect from misuse.  

  ![](images/Lab100/24.1.png)

- **NOTE for Linux and Mac Clients:** Just open up the pubic key file in an editor (vi) and select / copy the entire contents to be used in Step 1 of the next lab (200).

```
vi packerkey.pub
```

  ![](images/Lab100/25-4.png)

### **STEP 11 Windows**: Create SSH Key Pair (Windows client)

For Windows clients this example will show the use of PuttyGen to generate the keypair. [Putty and PuttyGen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) are available for download.

- Run **PuttyGen** and click **Generate**

    ![](images/Lab100/25.png)

- Once the generation process completes click the **Save Private Key** button and save to a directory of your choice.

- If prompted to save without a passphrase click yes.

  ![](images/Lab100/25a.png)

**NOTE:** `Do not save the public key as the format is not compatible with Linux openSSH.

- Instead, **Select the entire Public Key in the display and right-click copy**. `This content will be pasted into the Create Instance dialog in Step 1 of Lab 200.`

  ![](images/Lab100/25-2.png)

The result of this is creation of the SSH keypair:

- packerkey.pub (your public SSH key)
- packerkey (your private SSH key)

Ideally, your private key should be kept on your laptop with security measures in place which match the systems they can be used with.  Since the trial account can be converted to a production account, if you wish, it's a best-practice to think about security practices from the very first assets created.

**This completes this Lab!**

**You are ready to proceed to [Lab 200](Lab200.md)**
